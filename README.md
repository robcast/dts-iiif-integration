# dts-iiif-integration

Collecting ideas and information on the integration of the [Distibuted Text Services (DTS)](https://w3id.org/dts) and [International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF)](https://iiif.io) APIs.

This project was started as part of the [2021 DTS Hackathon](https://distributed-text-services.github.io/workshops/events/2021-hackathon/). Find a copy of the original ticket [here](dts-hackathon-18.md).

I will continue to work on the ideas outlined here. Please add comments and ideas as tickets!
